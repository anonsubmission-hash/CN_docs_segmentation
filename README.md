# Legal & Policy Document Segmentation

This repository provides a suite of tools to segment structured legal and policy documents using the OpenAI API. The process involves tagging individual lines of a document and then using those tags to create meaningful segments.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following set up:

1.  **OpenAI Account:** You need an account with OpenAI.
2.  **API Key:** You must generate an API key from your OpenAI account dashboard.
3.  **Environment Variable:** For security, it's best to set your API key as an environment variable. This project expects the key to be available as `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
4.  **Python Dependencies:** Install the necessary Python packages. It's recommended to create a `requirements.txt` file and install from it using:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage Workflow

Follow these steps to process your documents from raw text to a segmented CSV file.

### 1. Prepare Your Data

Place your raw text files in the `sample_data/txt_files/` directory. **Crucially, each line in every file must be prefixed with a line number**, followed by a space, as shown in the provided examples.

### 2. Submit Tagging Jobs

Run the batch_itemizer.py script to submit your text files to the OpenAI API for tagging. This script creates batch jobs for asynchronous processing.

python batch_itemizer.py

### 3. Retrieve Batch Results
After you've confirmed that all submitted batch jobs have been completed in the OpenAI dashboard, run the retrieve_batches.py script. This will fetch the processing results (line-by-line tags).

python retrieve_batches.py

### 4. Reconstruct Tagged Files
Execute the reconstruct_label_to_txt.py script to assemble the retrieved tags with the original text. The newly tagged files will be saved in the sample_data/txt_files_tagged/ directory.

python reconstruct_label_to_txt.py

### 5. Segment the Documents
Run the segmentation.py script to divide the tagged text files into logical segments. You may need to adjust the parameters within this script until you achieve a satisfactory level of segmentation.

python segmentation.py

### 6. Create Final CSV Output
Finally, run create_table_from_segmented_files.py to organize the segmented documents into a single .csv file. This file can then be used for further data analysis and processing.

python create_table_from_segmented_files.py
